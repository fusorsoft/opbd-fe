	<h2>What is Operation Breakdown?</h2>

	<p>Step up your game with Operation Breakdown.  Operation Breakdown takes your GOTV demos
	for Counter Strike: Global Offensive and extracts meaningful statistics to help you understand
	where you and your team need to improve. Operation Breakdown was created to address two simultaneous
	pain points compared to existing demo analyzers -- the alternatives either limit WHERE you can view
	your demo statistics, or WHEN the demos can be from.  Operation Breakdown takes your downloaded demos
	and makes the stats from them available online.
	</p>

	<h3>You do the processing</h3>
	<p>
		Using the client application, all of the heavy lifting is done on your computer.  This means
		that unlike other sites, there is no waiting in line while the servers strain under load
		from processing everyone else's demos.  Just analyze, upload, and dig in immediately.
	</p>

	<h3>It works with your saved demos</h3>

	<p>
		Match sharing codes expire after 28 days.  Your saved demos last forever.  We can take all
		those demos you've been saving up and compile statistics for every one of them.  During the
		beta go ahead and keep holding on to them, as new features may require reprocessing.
	</p>

	<h3>Your data, where you want it</h3>

	<p>
		Whether you're bootcamping in Barcelona, bored on a bus, or enjoying a beer at the bar,
		access your data from any device and any location.
	</p>

	<h3>It's fast</h3>
	<p>
		All of the hard work is done up front, one time.  Once your data is up on the site, you'll
		have instant access to all of your stats.  The information is also sharable; you can easily
		give your friends and teammates a link to a breakdown. Brag about a great game, or help
		explain areas for improvement.  The possiblities are endless.
	</p>

	<h3>Join the Operation</h3>

	<p>
		You may have data already waiting for you.  When a fellow gamer uploads data for a match you
		played in, it will automatically be made available to you.
